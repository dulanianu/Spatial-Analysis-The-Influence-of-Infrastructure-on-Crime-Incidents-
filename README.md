# Spatial-Analysis-The-Influence-of-Infrastructure-on-Crime-Incidents-

## Introduction
Every crime is inherently tied to a location, whether it be a street, address, district, or postal code. 
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have proven to be powerful tools for analysing these 
locational aspects. By connecting crime data with geographical information, crime mapping 
offers invaluable insights into spatial patterns and trends. As crime statistics are influenced by 
several factors—including population size, infrastructure and seasonal trends. 

This study focuses on **Chermside** and **Capalaba**, suburbs in Queensland to explore the relationship 
between infrastructure and crime incidents using spatial analysis techniques. By analysing 
offence data from Queensland Police Services, the research aims to identify the influence of 
infrastructure on crime incidents and investigate the distance decay relationship between 
incidents and the infrastructure in the suburb.
